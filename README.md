## Overview
SyncMaster is an innovative solution designed to provide seamless real-time synchronization between Google Sheets and relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. The primary objective of this project is to automate the synchronization process, ensuring that any changes made in either platform are accurately reflected in the other without manual intervention.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Sync**: Automatically synchronize data between Google Sheets and the specified database.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on both Google Sheets and the database.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implement strategies for handling conflicts when simultaneous changes occur in both platforms.
- **Scalability**: Design the solution to handle large datasets and high-frequency updates efficiently.

## Why SyncMaster?
Many businesses leverage Google Sheets for collaborative data management, but they often face challenges keeping this data in sync with their databases. This project addresses that need by automating the synchronization process, ensuring data accuracy and saving time.

## Technologies Involved

### Development Languages
- Python or Node.js are preferred for implementing the synchronization logic.

### Backend Databases
- MySQL and PostgreSQL will serve as the backend storage solutions.

### APIs
Utilize the following APIs to facilitate interactions:
- **Google Sheets API**: To read and update data in Google Sheets.
- **Google Drive API**: For managing files and data in Google Drive.
- **Google Cloud API**: To support cloud functionalities.

### AI Integration
- The use of LLM APIs (e.g., Gemini) is highly encouraged to enhance the system‚Äôs capabilities and performance.
