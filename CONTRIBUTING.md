## Rules

- Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.
- The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
- If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
- This year, the first 55,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

A repository/project is considered to be participating in Hacktoberfest if the 'hacktoberfest' topic is present and is accepting public contributions via pull requests. An individual pull request can also be opted-in directly by adding the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.
